# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

All cogs on the `master` branch will be kept up to date with security patches.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability you discovered message me on discord Dav#6998 or send me an E-Mail to [dav@mail.stopdavabuse.de](mailto:dav@mail.stopdavabuse.de).

I will reply to you as soon as possible but definitely within 7 days.

Do **NOT** publically disclose a vulnerability or open a fix PR without talking to me first.
